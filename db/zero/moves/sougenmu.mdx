## Usage and Extra Details

- Creates a shadow that mimics Zero's actions 16 frames later.
- Shadow lasts for 300 frames and disappears if Zero uses any other super.
- Invincible from frames 9-10.
- Arguably the best install super in the game. The doubled and slightly delayed actions makes all of his projectiles twice as strong and durable and improves the frame data on all of his normals.
- Gives Zero access to unblockables by forcing the opponent to block a high attack from the clone and a low from the player. Assists with long active frames like Hidden Missiles, Cold Star, or Jam Session
  make this super easy to setup.
- Zero does not gain any meter while Sougenmu is active. Because of this, you should try to be thoughtful about when to activate Sougenmu if you only have 1 meter. If they are cornered blocking a <InlineInput color="red" text="5H" />,
  that's a perfect time to activate because you should be able to set up an unblockable. Otherwise, you should try to build more meter before trying to active midscreen or fullscreen.
- With only 1 frame of recovery, it's nearly impossible to punish giving Zero another option to cancel an action into something safe.
- He can create a near perfect blockstrings at fullscreen with repeated <InlineInput text="236M" color="yellow" />.
