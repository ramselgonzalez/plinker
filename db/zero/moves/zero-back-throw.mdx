## Usage and Details

- Throws and throw techs resets Zero's buster charge.
- If _you_ have your back to the corner when you throw the opponent, you can confirm from back throw with <InlineInput color="red" text="j.236H" /> and an assist or X-Factor.
- Midscreen, you can confirm with <InputBlock><Text color="yellow">214M</Text> xx X-Factor Cancel, <Text color="yellow">j.236M</Text>, <Text color="blue">2L</Text></InputBlock>.
  It's a tough link but doable with practice.
