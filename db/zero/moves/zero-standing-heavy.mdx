## Usage and Details

- Chains into <InputBlock>6H</InputBlock>
- Moves Zero forward a bit.
- One of the best normal's in the game.
- It's large active (10 frames!) hitbox is effective as both a well spaced anti-air or a grounded pressure tool.
- Acts as combo filler on a grounded hit to give Zero time to charge Level 3 Buster, especially when chaining into <InputBlock>6H</InputBlock>.
- As a multi-hitting move, it destroys armor essentially defusing Hulk in the matchup.
- This button dominates characters with more grounded gameplans such as Wolverine, Hulk, and Haggar. A blocked <InputBlock>5H</InputBlock> can be followed up with
  an assist (Plasma Beam, Rapid Slash, Jam Session) and cancelled into a <InputBlock>236M</InputBlock>. This will push the character back a decent amount
  forcing them to try to close the space again while you get to continue zoning.
- If you'd prefer to be more aggressive after a blocked <InputBlock>5H</InputBlock>, you can attempt to mix them up by teleporting with <InputBlock>214M</InputBlock>
  instead and trying to mix with your assist behind you. This is a bit riskier since a poorly timed teleport can be throw punished with a proper pushblock.
