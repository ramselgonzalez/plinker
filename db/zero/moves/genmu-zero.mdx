## Usage and Details

- Projectile - 100 high durability point.
- Invincible from frames 1-24.
- A damaging Level 3 finisher. A good way to end combos after <InlineInput color="blue" text="j.623L" /> instead of doing Lightning Loops.
- One of the few Level 3s in the game that is not a cinematic super.
- In the corner, you can combo from Genmu Zero with a quick assist like Jam Session and <InlineInput color="yellow" text="j236M" />.
