## Usage and Details

- Zero's standard fireball.
- Projectile - 3 low durability points.
- Hadangeki L travels the slowest of the three versions but has the best frame data on block.
- This version also has the shortest recovery of the three which makes it a great projectile to throw out and move forward behind it. This allows you to react to your opponent
  while having a wall of durability protecting you. In Sougenmu, this is only strengthened since you'll have two projectiles equaling double the durability.
- When zoning fullscreen, it's good to switch up your Hadangeki pattern and throw in a Hadangeki L to either stack the durability of projectiles by quickly throwing out a Hadangeki M/H
  or to throw off your opponent's escape options.
