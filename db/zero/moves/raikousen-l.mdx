## Usage and Details

- Only soft knockdowns on airborne opponents.
- Can pass through opponents (even in the corner) leading to some of the most ambiguous incoming mixups ever.
- Like other specials, you can buster cancel it allowing you to send a lightning poke below you without committing to the trajectory.
- Raikousen L is the key to performing Zero's Lightning Loop. You can loop it indefinitely with Sougenmu activated due to its soft knockdown.
- On incoming, a properly spaced Raikousen L can either hit same side or crossup and be completely meaty making it impossible to air dash away.
