## Usage and Details

- Zero's fastest normal and tied with the fastest lows in the game (4 frames).
- A great button for setting up staggers for frame traps being only -1 on block. Linking <InlineInput text="2L" color="blue" /> into itself is likely to catch people pushblocking
  leading to a easy frame trap.
- Players must be comfortable with buster switching to get the most utility out of this button since you'll be likely using <InlineInput text="L" color="blue" /> to charge buster.
- A common mixup utilizing <InlineInput text="2L" color="blue" /> while the opponent is blocking an assist is to jump up and perform <InputBlock><Text color="blue">j.214L</Text>, <Text color="blue">2L</Text></InputBlock>.
  It's a very potent empty jump low setup that hits even the most experienced players.
