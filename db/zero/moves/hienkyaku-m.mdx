## Usage and Details

- Can pass through opponents.
- Travels a farther dstance than Hienkyaku L.
- Covers horizontal distance much faster than dashing so it can be an alternative for ground movement in some cases where you need to closer a gap quickly or travel underneath an airborne opponent.
- Effective at creating left/right mixups with Level 3 Buster or an assist.
- Can be used to negate pushblock. Since it travels a much farther distance than Hienkyaku L, Zero can still end up behind the opponent after being pushblocked out.
