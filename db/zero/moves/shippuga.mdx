## Usage and Details

- A multi-hitting normal.
- Great combo filler on grounded hits to give Zero time to charge buster.
- Incredibly good frame data on block and on hit. You can link a <InputBlock>2L</InputBlock> from a grounded <InputBlock>6H</InputBlock> hit.
- It can be chained into from any normal, usually from <InputBlock>5H</InputBlock>.
- With Sougenmu activated, you can link Shippuga into itself to create an infinite blockstring. If the opponent begins pushblocking the last hit of <InputBlock>6H</InputBlock>,
  you can add a microdash into <InputBlock>6H</InputBlock> to keep yourself within range while still keeping it a true blockstring. This blockstring is key for Zero's unblockable setup.
  Calling a lockdown assist like Jam Session or Hidden Missiles during this string gives you plenty of time to setup the unblockable.
