## Usage and Details

- Another one of Zero's solid anti-airs.
- Moves him forward a decent amount.
- Mostly used as combo filler early on in a combo to prevent scaling from ramping up. On a grounded hit, doing <InputBlock>2L > 2M > 2H > 5S</InputBlock>
  will scale significantly less than <InputBlock>2L > 2M > 5H > 6H > 5S</InputBlock>
  due to the lack of multi-hitting normals. The optimal chain can be a little finnicky at time midscreen because sometimes Zero can end up behind the opponent after the launcher super jump cancel.
