## Usage and Details

- Throws and throw techs resets Zero's buster charge.
- At normal jump height you can do <InputBlock>ADB + Assist xx <Text color="red">j.236H</Text></InputBlock> to confirm from the throw.
- At superjump height, the confirm must be modified to <InputBlock><Text color="blue">j.214L</Text>, Assist + Jump > <Text color="yellow">j.214M</Text>, <Text color="yellow">j.236M</Text></InputBlock>.
  This only works with horizontal assists like Plasma Beam and Unibeam.
