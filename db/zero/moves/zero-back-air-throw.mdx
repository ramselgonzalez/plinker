## Usage and Details

- Throws and throw techs resets Zero's buster charge.
- At normal jump height you can do <InputBlock>ADB + Assist xx j.236H</InputBlock> to confirm from the throw.
- At superjump height, the confirm must be modified to <InputBlock>j.214L, Assist + Jump > j.214M, j.236M</InputBlock>.
  This only works with horizontal assists like Plasma Beam and Unibeam.
