## Usage and Details

- Zero's standard fireball.
- Projectile - 3 low durability points.
- Hadangeki H has the slowest start up of the three versions but shoots out two projectiles instead. This makes it the most damaging and most projectile durable
  of the three.
- Cancelling Hadangeki H into Level 3 Buster gives Zero massive projectile durability that is nearly impossible to challenge.
- You can use Hadangeki H off a grounded hit to get a very optimal starter. <InputBlock><Text color="blue">2L</Text> > <Text color="yellow">2M</Text> > <Text color="red">2H</Text> xx <Text color="red">236H</Text> xx Buster Release, <Text color="yellow">5M</Text> > <Text color="red">2H</Text> > <Text color="green">5S</Text></InputBlock>
