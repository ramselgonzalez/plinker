## Usage and Details

- Zero's non-invincible DP.
- Ryuenjin M travels vertically more than Ryuenjin L but less than Ryuenjin H.
- This move has no uses in neutral but has some combo uses. The final hit of Ryuenjin M has a fixed amount of hitstun where the opponent falls down slighty.
  It can help normalize the height of the opponent for the Level 3 Buster Cancel followup after a DP.
