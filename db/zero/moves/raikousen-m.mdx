## Usage and Details

- Only soft knockdowns on airborne opponents.
- Can pass through opponents (even in the corner).
- Can be used as a movement tool since Zero travels horizontally at such a high speed. Needs to be combined with a buster cancel because by itself, Raikousen is in recovery until landing.
  You can buster cancel at any moment of Raikousen to either create a short or far teleport.
- It can also be used as a full range poke with an instant buster cancel. This is a great for catching people moving in the air. To confirm you can do <InputBlock><Text color="yellow">j.623M</Text> xx Instant Air Buster Release, <Text color="yellow">j.214M</Text>, <Text color="red">j.2H</Text> > <Text color="green">j.S</Text></InputBlock>
  or <InputBlock><Text color="yellow">j.623M</Text> xx Instant Air Buster Release, <Text color="blue">j.214L</Text>, Dash Forward > <Text color="green">S</Text></InputBlock> if closer to the opponent.
- You can do a TK Raikousen M for an incredibly low to ground crossup. If performed at the correct height, you can confirm by linking <InlineInput color="blue" text="2L"/> as you land.
