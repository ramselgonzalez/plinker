## Usage and Details

- Not special cancelable. It can only chain into <InputBlock>j.S</InputBlock>.
- A solid air normal that is incredibly hard to punish due to the hitboxes surrounding Zero.
- As an air-to-air, it can be a little inconsistent to confirm from. Since it isn't special cancelable, you'll have to chain into <InputBlock>j.S</InputBlock>.
  and then release buster. If you aren't at the apex of your jump arc, your <InputBlock>j.S</InputBlock> tends to whiff.
- Overall, you don't really want to use <InputBlock>j.H</InputBlock> as an air-to-air or air-to-ground move. <InputBlock>j.2H</InputBlock>, "pizza-cutter", is the
  better button overall.
