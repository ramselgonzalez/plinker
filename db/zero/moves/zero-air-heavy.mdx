## Usage and Details

- Not special cancelable. It can only chain into <InlineInput text="j.S" color="green" />.
- A solid air normal that is incredibly hard to punish due to the hitboxes surrounding Zero.
- As an air-to-air, it can be a little inconsistent to confirm from. Since it isn't special cancelable, you'll have to chain into <InlineInput text="j.S" color="green" />
  and then release buster. If you aren't at the apex of your jump arc, your <InlineInput text="j.S" color="green" /> tends to whiff.
- Overall, you don't really want to use <InlineInput text="j.H" color="red" /> as an air-to-air or air-to-ground move. <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red" />, "pizza-cutter", is the
  better button overall.
