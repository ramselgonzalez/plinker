## Usage and Details

- Beam - 30 frames x 1 high durability point.
- An OTG combo ender however not a particularly good one. There is a sizable delay after the super flash before the move comes out. Due to that delay, the super will not combo outside of specific enders.
  It's generally not worth using since Lightning Loops do nearly twice as much damage for one meter.
