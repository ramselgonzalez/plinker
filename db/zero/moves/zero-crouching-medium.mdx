  against falling opponents.
- As a low hitting sword normal, Zero can safely poke outside of the ranges of many other characters options. He can catch opponents as the land and whiff air normals
  such as Doctor Doom's <InlineInput text="j.5M" color="yellow" /> or Morrigan's <InlineInput text="j.S" color="green" />.
- You can also use this normal to create really quick mixups with assists. <InputBlock><Text color="yellow">2M</Text> + Jam Session xx <Text color="yellow">214M</Text></InputBlock>
  is an easy auto-timed mixup that can catch people off guard under pressure.
