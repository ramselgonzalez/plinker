## Usage and Details

- Commonly referred to as "pizza cutter."
- Not special cancellable, similarly to <InputBlock>j.5H</InputBlock>. Only chains into <InputBlock>j.S</InputBlock>.
- One of the most oppressive air normals in the game. It's large and active hitbox makes it incredibly hard to grab or punish while active.
- Does great as both a falling normal and rising air-to-air.
- As a falling normal, it has a hitbox behind Zero so you can abuse that for crossups while is blocking, afraid to challenge the button.
- To be effective as an air-to-air at super jump height, it's best if it hits at the apex of your jump arc so that
  you can chain into <InputBlock>j.S</InputBlock> without it whiffing.
- Best performed as <InputBlock>j.3H</InputBlock> so you get a throw OS while navigating neutral.
- Cancelling your airdash (after its startup) into <InputBlock>j.2H</InputBlock> gives you the forward momentum you need to apply pressure and get crossups.
