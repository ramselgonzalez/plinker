## Usage and Details

- Commonly referred to as "pizza cutter."
- Not special cancellable, similarly to <InlineInput text="j.5H" color="red" />. Only chains into <InlineInput text="j.S" color="green" />
- One of the most oppressive air normals in the game. It's large and active hitbox makes it incredibly hard to grab or punish while active.
- Does great as both a falling normal and rising air-to-air.
- As a falling normal, it has a hitbox behind Zero so you can abuse that for crossups while is blocking, afraid to challenge the button.
- To be effective as an air-to-air at super jump height, it's best if it hits at the apex of your jump arc so that
  you can chain into <InlineInput text="j.S" color="green" /> without it whiffing.
- Best performed as <InlineInput text="j.3H" color="red" /> so you get a throw OS while navigating neutral.
- Cancelling your airdash (after its startup) into <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red" /> gives you the forward momentum you need to apply pressure and get crossups.
