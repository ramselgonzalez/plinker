## Usage and Details

- Throws and throw techs resets Zero's buster charge.
- It's generally easy to confirm off of Front Air Throw. You can simply land and jump and call just about any assist with a decent amount of active frames (Plasma Beam, Jam Session, Unibeam, Rapid Slash)
  and perform <InlineInput text="j.236H" color="red" />. You can do <InlineInput text="j.214L" color="blue" /> as soon as possible as well if you want to land earlier from superjump height.
