## Usage and Details

- Throws and throw techs resets Zero's buster charge.
- It's generally easy to confirm off of Front Air Throw. You can simply land and jump and call just about any assist with a decent amount of active frames (Plasma Beam, Jam Session, Unibeam, Rapid Slash)
  and perform <InputBlock>j.236H</InputBlock>. You can do <InputBlock>j.214L</InputBlock> as soon as possible as well if you want to land earlier from superjump height.
