## Usage and Details

- One of Zero's divekicks.
- Travels down at a roughly 30 degree angle.
- Causes a hard knockdown if used in a launcher combo.
- A good tool to quickly reach the ground with a hitbox out. Alternating this with <InputBlock>j.236H</InputBlock> can make your downward trajectory hard to read
  and can score you some mixups if behind an assist.
- Starts up faster than <InputBlock>j.236H</InputBlock> but does a little less damage.
- Useful in combos if you need to either quickly OTG (most commonly after a corner forward throw) the opponent
  or quickly launch them back down.
