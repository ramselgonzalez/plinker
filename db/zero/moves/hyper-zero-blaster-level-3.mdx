## Usage and Details

- Commonly referred to as "Buster".
- Beam - 3 frames x 3 low durability points.
- Requires 150 frames of charging.
- You can transfer your charge to another button as long as the initial button is not released.
- It has the unique ability to be able to be cancelled into from any normal (except for <InputBlock>j.H</InputBlock> and <InputBlock>j.2H</InputBlock>) or special.
- This is the neutral defining move in all of UMVC3. It's massive hitbox and durability combined with a 5 frame start up _and_ a **soft knockdown** allows for a variety of uses.
  It can be used as:
  - An assist punish. It's unique property of being a beam while looking like a projectile allows it to blast through most projectile assists. You can release buster on reaction
    to an assist call for a guaranteed punish.
  - A fullscreen punish. If an opponent commits to projectile at fullscreen you can punish with <InputBlock>Buster Release xx 214XX, 236M, 214M, Buster Release, Dash Forward > S</InputBlock>.
  - A scramble option. Level 3 Buster can be cancelled into from any special or normal (except for <InputBlock>j.H</InputBlock> and <InputBlock>j.2H</InputBlock>). So if you feel like
    you've made a mistake, releasing buster at the right time to keep yourself safe or outright punish your opponent's attempt to strike.
  - A blockstring ender or frame trap. Level 3 Buster is **+2 on block** meaning it's an incredibly safe and advantageous way to end blockstrings especially if opponents aren't pushblocking leaving themselves
    open to frame traps.
  - Additional durability in your zoning. You can cancel any Hadangeki into Level 3 Buster and it will outright beat most zoning options, even ones backed by an assist. The durability is that good! <InputBlock>236H + Beam Assist xx Buster Release</InputBlock>
    defeats just about anything an opponent can throw at you.
  - A crossup. When an opponent is blocking an assist in front of you, you can do <InputBlock>214M xx Buster Release</InputBlock> for a super fast crossup.
