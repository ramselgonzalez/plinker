## Usage and Details

- Zero's second fastest normal, tied with <InputBlock>j.5L</InputBlock>.
- Can be used to set up a frame trap by linking <InputBlock>5L</InputBlock> into itself but not nearly as good at it as <InputBlock>2L</InputBlock>.
- Not much utility outside of some tight air-to-air confirms.
- It's a rarely used button since you'll be buster charging with <InputBlock>L</InputBlock> most of the time.
