## Usage and Details

- Zero's second fastest normal, tied with <InlineInput text="j.5L" color="blue" />.
- Can be used to set up a frame trap by linking <InlineInput text="5L" color="blue" /> into itself but not nearly as good at it as <InlineInput text="2L" color="blue" />.
- Not much utility outside of some tight air-to-air confirms.
- It's a rarely used button since you'll be buster charging with <InlineInput text="L" color="blue" /> most of the time.
