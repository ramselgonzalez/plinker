## Usage and Details

- Can pass through opponents.
- Functions the same as <Link href="/zero/moves/hienkyaku-m">Hienkyaku M</Link>.
- A great mobility to cover horizontal space in the air. Ideally, you use <InlineInput color="yellow" text="j.214M"/> before using your air dash so that you can react to the situation and air dash out if needed.
- Also great at escaping the corner when under pressure. Doing <InputBlock>Superjump > <Text color="yellow">j.214M</Text></InputBlock> will get you out of the corner faster than just
  an air dash.
