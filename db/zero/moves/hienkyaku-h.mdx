## Usage and Details

- Can pass through opponents even in the corner.
- Even though there is a animation for his downward trajectory, you can cancel the dash with any air action at the apex of the command dash (i.e air dash or an air normal).
  This is especially useful because it can get you up to superjump height without actually superjumping giving you access to assists.
- A generally safe way to end blockstrings is to cancel into Hienkyaku H and pick one of many options:
  - Fall down with <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red" />.
  - Air dash back to reset neutral.
  - Press your advantage with air dash forward into <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red" /> or <InlineInput  text="j.236H" color="red" /> with an assist.
