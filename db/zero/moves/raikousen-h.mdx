## Usage and Details

- Only soft knockdowns on airborne opponents.
- Can pass through opponents (even in the corner).
- Can be used as a movement tool when combined with a buster cancel. More specifically, it can get you to superjump height without superjumping so that
  you can call your assists while high up in the air.
- It can also be used as a full range poke with an instant buster cancel. This is a great for catching people moving in the air or trying to superjump away in the corner.
