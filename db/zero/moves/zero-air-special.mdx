## Usage and Details

- A standard air launcher used to spike opponents back to the ground after an air combo post <InlineInput text="5S" color="green" />.
- It has a large hitbox above it making it a solid choice for a rising air-to-air, sometimes better than <InlineInput text="j.M" color="yellow" /> or <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red" />.
- On hit it pulls the opponent down in the air. It has _a lot_ of hitstun if used as a combo starter.
  You can do <InputBlock><Text color="green">j.S</Text> xx <Text color="blue">j.214L</Text>, <Text color="blue">5L</Text></InputBlock> as a superjump confirm. This can even work when confirming
  of a high up Jam Session hit. It's a useful confirm to know when you don't have Level 3 Buster charged.
