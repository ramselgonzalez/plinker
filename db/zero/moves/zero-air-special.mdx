## Usage and Details

- A standard air launcher used to spike opponents back to the ground after an air combo post <InputBlock>S</InputBlock>.
- It has a large hitbox above it making it a solid choice for a rising air-to-air, sometimes better than <InputBlock>j.M</InputBlock> or <InputBlock>j.2H</InputBlock>.
- On hit it pulls the opponent down in the air. It has _a lot_ of hitstun if used as a combo starter.
  You can do <InputBlock>j.S xx j.214L, 5L</InputBlock> as a superjump confirm. This can even work when confirming
  of a high up Jam Session hit. It's a useful confirm to know when you don't have Level 3 Buster charged.
