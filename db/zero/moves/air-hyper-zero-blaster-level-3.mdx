## Usage and Details

- Commonly referred to as "Buster".
- Beam - 3 frames x 3 low durability points.
- Requires 150 frames of charging.
- You can transfer your charge to another button as long as the initial button is not released.
- It has the unique ability to be able to be cancelled into from any normal (except for <InlineInput text="j.H" color="red"/> and <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red"/>) or special. With that in mind, <InputBlock><Text color="yellow">j.623M</Text> xx Air Buster Release</InputBlock>
  and <InputBlock><Text color="yellow">j.623H</Text> xx Air Buster Release</InputBlock> are key to Zero's fullscreen pressure.
- This is the neutral defining move in all of UMVC3. It's massive hitbox and durability combined with a 5 frame start up _and_ a **soft knockdown** allows for a variety of uses.
  It can be used as:
  - An assist punish. A simple super jump into buster release is an easy assist punish on reaction. It's nearly impossible to counter an air buster so it'll blast an opponent's at assist while you hang on the opposite corner of the screen.
  - A scramble option. Level 3 Buster can be cancelled into from any special or normal (except for <InlineInput text="j.H" color="red"/> and <InlineInput text="j.2H" color="red"/>). So if you feel like
    you've made a mistake, releasing buster at the right time to keep yourself safe or outright punish your opponent's attempt to strike.
  - A confirm tool. Due to it's guaranteed Soft Knockdown, confirming from any stray hit at super jump height is trivial. Simply <InputBlock>Air Buster Release, <Text color="blue">j.214L</Text>, Dash Forward, <Text color="green">S</Text></InputBlock>
    to confirm off most hits.
