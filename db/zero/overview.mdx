## Introduction \{#introduction\}

Zero is the best character in the game (some may say it's Morrigan but that's a discussion for another day).
He outclasses everybody in just about everything whether it's rushdown, zoning, or movement. He controls the pace of neutral with **Level 3 Buster** due to its
massive projectile durability and quick start up. His Raikousen buster cancels let him safely poke from full screen while also have options to confirm from any hit anywhere on the screen.

Once paired with some of his favorite assists, Jam Session or Hidden Missiles, he becomes and unstoppable force with access to even more ambiguous mixups,
_unblockables_, and high damage meter effecient combos.

As a point character, he dominates neutral with his great movement, strong projectile game, and **Sougenmu**. Sougenmu is one of the best install supers in the game
that strengthens his rushdown and zoning even more than it already was. Even though Zero doesn't build meter while in Sougenmu, he is incredibly meter effecient and can kill
just about anybody with only 1 bar thanks to lightning loops.

## Pros and Cons \{#pros-and-cons\}

### Pros \{#pros\}

- Strong full screen presence with Hadangeki, Level 3 Buster, and Raikousen buster cancels.
- Many options for moving around the screen in the air including a 2-Way Air Dash, Hienkyaku, and Raikousen.
- Best corner incoming mixups _especially_ with Jam Session.
- A slew of good normals such as <InputBlock>2M</InputBlock>, <InputBlock>5H</InputBlock>, <InputBlock>2H</InputBlock>, and <InputBlock>j.2H</InputBlock> ("pizza cutter").
- Small floaty body causes some combos require adjustments from the opponent.
- Sougenmu gives Zero access to unblockables.
- Confirms from anywhere on the screen with the forced soft knockdown of Level 3 Buster.

### Cons \{#cons\}

- Average assists.
- ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Team Compositions \{#team-compositions\}

**Zero is best played as a point character**. With two assists behind him, he is an unstoppable force in neutral. There is little to no reason to put him in middle or anchor position
since he dominates just about every matchup.

### Zero / Vergil / Dante \{#zero-vergil-dante\}

#### Assists: Ryuenjin / Rapid Slash / Jam Session

This is the most popular Zero team composition. Zero and Dante are best friends and gives him the ability to control the vertical space while being able to confirm
from Jam Session at any height with Level 3 Buster. On incoming, Jam Session only strengthens his already ambiguous mixup game. Rapid Slash is a surprisingly potent combo with Zero's zoning
leading to a lot of easy conversions from fullscreen projectiles.

Having Vergil 2nd gives the team safe DHCs that lead to more pressure
should you need to get Zero out. Vergil/Dante is an oppressive shell on its own but ideally you get Vergil out if things begin going south so that he is left in the anchor
position.

### Zero / Doctor Doom / Vergil \{#zero-doctor-doom-vergil\}

#### Assists: Ryuenjin / Hidden Missiles or Plasma Beam / Rapid Slash

Most UMVC3 players would agree that just about any character would benefit from having Doctor Doom and Vergil behind them; Zero is no different. Hidden Missiles is such
a powerful assist for Zero because Level 3 Buster practically guarantees it doesn't get interrupted by the opponent allowing Zero to apply pressure behind
Hidden Missiles. And just like with Jam Session, very gets easy unblockables with Hidden Missiles when in Sougenmu.

### Zero / Doctor Doom / Dante \{#zero-doctor-doom-dante\}

#### Assists: Ryuenjin / Hidden Missiles or Plasma Beam / Jam Session

This Zero team composition is a bit more front-loaded. It trades Vergil, a strong anchor, for Dante, a less powerful anchor with a better assist. This variant gives Zero
two strong assists to play with to dominate neutral and two assists that can give him [unnecessarily high damage, meter effecient combos](https://twitter.com/dylnyan/status/1305352195307520000?s=20&t=deDD5ogCHQqDowcHFgADCw).
The Doom/Dante shell is strong enough to make comebacks and deal massive damage but isn't as strong as the Vergil/Doom shell.
