## Introduction

Zero is arguably the best character in the game (some may say it's Morrigan but that's a discussion for another day).
He outclasses everybody in just about everything whether it's rushdown, zoning, or moving around the screen. He controls the pace of neutral with **Level 3 Buster** due to its
massive projectile durability and quick start up. His Raikousen buster cancels let him safely poke from full screen while also have options to confirm from any hit from
anywhere on the screen.

Once paired with some of his favorite assists, **Jam Session** or **Hidden Missiles**, he becomes and unstoppable force which access to even more ambiguous mixups,
_unblockables_, and even stronger neutral presence.

As a point character he dominates neutral with his superior movement, strong projectile game, and access to **Sougenmu**. Sougenmu is one of the best install supers in the game
that strengthens his rushdown and zoning even more than it already was. Even though Zero doesn't build meter while in Sougenmu, he is incredibly meter effecient and can kill
just about anybody with only 1 bar thanks to lightning loops.

## Pros and Cons

- Strong full screen presence with Hadangekis, Raikousen buster cancels, and Level 3 Buster.
- Many options for moving around the screen in the air including a 2-Way Air Dash, Hienkyaku, and Raikousen.
- A slew of good normals such as 2M, 5H, 2H, and j.2H ("pizza cutter").
- Small floaty body makes some combos require adjustments from the opponent.
- Sougenmu gives Zero access to unblockables.
- Confirms from anywhere on the screen with the guaranteed soft knockdown of Level 3 Buster.

- Low health.
- Below average assists.
- Zero doesn't build meter in Sougenmu.

## Team Compositions

Zero is best played as a point character. With two assists behind him, he is an unstoppable force in neutral. There is no reason to put him in middle or anchor position
since he dominates just about every matchup.

#### Assists: Ryuenjin / Rapid Slash / Jam Session

This is probably the most popular Zero team composition. Zero and Dante are best friends and gives Zero the ability to control the vertical space while being able to confirm
from any hit with Jam Session. On incoming, Jam Session only strengthens his already ambiguous mixup game. Rapid Slash assist is a surprisingly potent combo with Zero's zoning
leading to a lot of easy conversions from projectiles.

Having Vergil 2nd gives the team safe DHCs that lead to more pressure
should you need to get Zero out. Vergil/Dante is an oppressive shell on its own but ideally you get Vergil out if things begin going south so that he is left in the anchor
position.

#### Assists: Ryuenjin / Hidden Missiles / Rapid Slash

Most UMVC3 players would agree that just about any character would benefit from having Doctor Doom and Vergil behind them; Zero is no different. Hidden Missiles is such
a potent assist for Zero because Level 3 Buster practically guarantees it doesn't get interrupted by the opponent allowing Zero to apply pressure behind
Hidden Missiles. And just like with Jam Session, very gets easy unblockables with Hidden Missiles when in Sougenmu.
