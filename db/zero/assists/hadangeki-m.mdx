## Usage and Extra Details

Hadangeki M is the fast moving version of his projectile. It does an okay job at adding some extra durability to your zoning but it shouldn't be used as replacement for some of the
better horizontal coverage assists like Plasma Beam or Unibeam.

- When in Sougenmu, Zero will throw out two projectiles instead of one so the durability and lockdown is doubled up.
