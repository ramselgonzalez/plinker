## Usage and Extra Details

While Zero doesn't have spectacular assists, Ryuenjin H might be the one worth picking. It has a decent hitbox with fast start up but it's lack of invincibility makes
generally weak as a DP assist unlike how they were in Marvel vs Capcom 2. It can help characters get some worth while extensions such as Vergil getting a full combo from a Helm Breaker
into High Time with Ryuenjin assist.

- When used as an **Alpha Counter**, Ryuenjin H is invincible during its start-up frames and early active frames.
- Zero can actually get a full combo from the Alpha Counter if you have an extra bar to spend to cancel the first hit into Sougenmu.
- If Zero is in Sougenmu, the assist will also be cloned.
