## Usage and Extra Details

Shippuga is Zero's worst assist and not useful even in niche situations. It sends Zero forward with a hitbox that is only active for 7 frames leaving Zero as a sitting duck waiting
to be punished. It's not good for combo extensions, counter calling, or lockdown.

Do not use this assist.
