## Purpose

This combo is to understand how Zero can relaunch midscreen without an assist. <InputBlock>OTG j.236H xx Air Buster Release, j.214L, Dash Forward j.S</InputBlock>
is a universal relaunch. Depending on the starter, you can add <InputBlock>5M</InputBlock> or <InputBlock>5H</InputBlock> after the <InputBlock>j.214L</InputBlock> for a little bit of extra damage/meter and
some leniency in the timing instead of going straight for the <InputBlock>S</InputBlock>.
