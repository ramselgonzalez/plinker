## Purpose

The purpose of this combo is to understand the timing of Zero's buster lightning relaunch. Doing OTG j.236H into Air Buster Release then cancelling into j.623L is how Zero
extends his combos by himself. Getting comfortable with the Air Buster Release xx j.623L input is a good segue into learning Lightning Loops.

## Character Specific Info

There are two important things to know about this solo relaunch with Zero.

- It does not work on **Amaterasu** and **Shuma**. You'll need to use a different route (OTG j.236H xx Air Buster Release xx j.214L, j.S) to solo relaunch _or_ use assists. It's important to
  learn routes with your team for these two characters, especially when trying to go into Lightning Loops.
- On specific heavier characters (**Magneto, Wesker, Doctor Strange**), you'll need to delay your OTG j.236H a bit or else the Air Buster Release xx j.623L will drop. As a visual cue, you
  wait until the opponents legs slam to the floor after the hard knockdown. In some routes, this is auto-timed and you don't have to think about it.
