  description: Use a Level 3 Buster Cancel to extend a Zero combo in the corner.

## Purpose

This combo is for understanding the timing of Zero's solo buster lightning relaunch. Doing <InputBlock>OTG j.236H</InputBlock> and releasing buster before Zero is grounded followed by <InputBlock>j.236L</InputBlock> is how Zero
extends his combos in the corner. Getting comfortable with the <InputBlock>Air Buster Release, j.623L</InputBlock> input is a good segue into learning Lightning Loops.

## Character Specific Info

There are two important things to know about the <InputBlock>OTG j.236H xx Air Buster Release, j.623L</InputBlock> solo relaunch with Zero.

- It does **not** work on **Amaterasu** and **Shuma**. You'll need to use a different route, <InputBlock>OTG j.236H xx Air Buster Release, j.214L, j.S</InputBlock>, to solo relaunch. It's important to
  learn routes with your team for these two characters, especially when trying to go into Lightning Loops.
- On specific heavier characters (Magneto, Wesker, Doctor Strange), you'll need to delay your <InputBlock>OTG j.236H</InputBlock> a bit or else the <InputBlock>Air Buster Release, j.623L</InputBlock> will drop. As a visual cue, you
  wait until the opponents legs slam to the floor after the hard knockdown. In some routes, this is auto-timed and you don't have to think about it.
