## Purpose

This combo is for understanding the timing of Zero's solo buster lightning relaunch. Doing <InputBlock>OTG <Text color="red">j.236H</Text></InputBlock> and releasing buster before Zero is grounded followed by <InlineInput text="j.623L" color="blue" /> is how Zero
extends his combos in the corner. Getting comfortable with the <InputBlock>Air Buster Release, <Text color="blue">j.623L</Text></InputBlock> input is a good segue into learning Lightning Loops.

## Character Specific Info

There are two important things to know about the <InputBlock>OTG <Text color="red">j.236H</Text> xx Air Buster Release, <Text color="blue">j.623L</Text></InputBlock> solo relaunch with Zero.

- It does **not** work on **Amaterasu** and **Shuma**. You'll need to use a different route, <InputBlock>OTG <Text color="red">j.236H</Text> xx Air Buster Release, <Text color="blue">j.214L</Text>, <Text color="green">j.S</Text></InputBlock>, to solo relaunch. It's important to
  learn routes with your team for these two characters, especially when trying to go into Lightning Loops.
- On specific heavier characters (Magneto, Wesker, Doctor Strange), you'll need to delay your <InputBlock>OTG <Text color="red">j.236H</Text></InputBlock> a bit or else the <InputBlock>Air Buster Release, <Text color="blue">j.623L</Text></InputBlock> will drop. As a visual cue, you
  wait until the opponents legs slam to the floor after the hard knockdown. In some routes, this is auto-timed and you don't have to think about it.
